# Week 16 Mon Lab #
### Overview  ###
In this lab, you will implement several core operations using the binary heap data structure. 

* Binary tree space analysis
* Complete binary trees
* Min-heap / Max-heap insertion (sift-up and sift-down)
* Removing nodes
* Heapsort

You will complete partially written C++ code (“pre-code”) that implements:

* A vector-based binary heap
* Insertion using sift-up
* Removal of the root using sift-down
* Removal of an arbitrary index (sift-up then sift-down)

You will be making changes in the minHeap.tpp file and implement the code in heapsort method in Week16Mon.cpp.
